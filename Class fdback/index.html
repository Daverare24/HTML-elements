            <h2> Facts about Space</h2>
            <p>
                Space is silent: Space is completely silent because there is no atmosphere to carry sound. 
Black holes are invisible: Black holes don't give off or reflect light, so they are invisible to telescopes. 
The solar system is old: Our solar system is about 4.571 billion years old. 
The Sun is massive: The Sun is so large that Earth could fit inside it 1.3 million times. 
There are many stars: There are more stars in space than grains of sand on Earth. 
The footprints on the moon will last: The footprints left by the Apollo 11 astronauts will likely remain for at least 100 million years because there is no atmosphere to erode them. 
Cold welding: If two pieces of the same metal touch in space, they will permanently stick together due to cold welding. 
Neptune has supersonic winds: Neptune has the fastest winds in our solar system, reaching speeds of up to 1600 miles per hour. 
Jupiter's Great Red Spot: Jupiter's Great Red Spot is a gigantic storm that stretches deep into the planet's atmosphere. 
Space junk: There are almost 10,000 metric tons of man-made space waste orbiting Earth. It can take years or decades for this debris to fall back to Earth.

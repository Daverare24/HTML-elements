      <h1> Catherine's Fabulous Life😍✌ </h1>
      <Label>INTRODUCTION:
        <p> Hey there!  Welcome to my story, ah!  So sorry, where are my manners? My name is Catherine Amelia Lakes, but you can call me Cat, for short though…, I’m 16, actually I’m 15, I’ll be turning 16 in a month… I have 4 super annoying siblings, the first one’s Charlie, he’s my older bro, he’s in University, but he is the best of all of ‘em. My younger siblings are Cassie, Cody & Carly.
                I go to Daystar High School, while my siblings go to Princeton Middle School. I’m in the 10th grade, school’s actually okay, but there are some loopholes, like mean girls and some others… but it’s something I’ve grown to love. 
           We moved from London to one of the United States, New York City. My parents, Mr. Stanley Lakes & Mrs. Charlotte Lakes, just decided (out of the bloom!), we’d move to New York, that was when I found out that my life was officially OVER!! My siblings and I weren’t totally in “with the plan”, but as you know it, we kids aren’t in total control over our lives, so we still left for New York City, only our brother Charlie, got to stay back ‘cos if he’d leave the university he was in & came with us, it would be very difficult for him to be admitted into another university in the middle of the school year.
        Anyways, I was devastated when we moved away [oh and no, I would never ever stay back in London with Charlie in charge]. Mom said that she was happy that we’d get to start our lives all over again, meet new people, try out new things, make new friends & even make long lasting memories!! BLARGHHH! So guys, this is he account of how my life in N.Y.C turned out to be;
